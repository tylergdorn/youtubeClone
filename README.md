# Youtube Clone
## Background
In order to be more productive, one of my friends decided to ban youtube. Good for him! It can take up a lot of time. However, I did like sending him youtube videos. I made this python script to solve my problems. It's a bit unsightly, but seems to work good.

## Prerequisites

I use [streamable](https://streamable.com/) to upload videos too, and you may [note](https://streamable.com/documentation) that you need an account for that. So, you will need to make an account and put the username/password in a file called `pass.txt` with the first line being your username and the next line being your streamable password.  
Example: 
```
user@email.com
password
```
I don't steal your login! promise!

## Example Usage

`python3 y2streamable.py https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taWzoLpdxaI`  
if you're on windows it is probably just python  
You don't have to use that specific link, it should work for whatever
